Hello! Welcome to DeafConnect! This is a website that allows users to keep track of the Deaf friendliness of businesses. You can create an account by clicking ‘Create an account’ on the top bar. Here, you will fill in form for username, first name, last name, email address, and password. Once you have created your account, you can login and access the home page. On the home page you will see businesses that have been added by other users. If you click on the business’s image, or click on the blue hyperlink “Read and Leave Reviews” below the image, it will bring you to a details page where you can see the average rating (which is an average of every rating that has been left by a user) as well as the reviews each user has left. You can scroll down and leave reviews of your own as well. You can type your message in the textbox, then select a number, 0 through 10, on the sliding scale beneath the textbox. Once you have submitted you will see that your review is listed and that the average review has changed to reflect your rating. If you made a mistake or changed your mind, you can edit or delete your review. On the home page, you can also search for a business in the search bar to see if it is listed. If the business you want to review is not listed, you can add it by clicking ‘add a business’ in the top bar. Thank you for using DeafConnect! I hope you enjoy the app! If you have any concerns or recommendations about DeafConnect, please email me at deafconnect@gmail.com. Thank you again!
